@splitend89 Microsoft better break out the checkbook for a big third party game or two to come to Game Pass this fall because Forza ain\xe2\x80\x99t enough, chief.

Sony can learn a lot from Microsoft and how they embraced Linux and the open source community

It sucks to see the delays but great to see the Microsoft quality control in the works. Expectations should be much higher now. https://t.co/1WMcQQewW7

"b""Bethesda delays 'Starfield' to 2023\nhttps://t.co/UHGYKIbdMm\nTwo of Bethesda's highest-profile games won't make their long-promised release dates. The Microsoft-owned company has delayed both the sci-fi RPG Starfield and Arkane's vampire shooter Redfall to the first half of 2023."""
b'THE MICROSOFT WORD SOUND-'
b'@bethesda @videogamedeals Why is everyone saying Microsoft is ruining the studio. Bethesda\xe2\x80\x98s history is to release games unfinished. These two games should be released finished with little updates to do besides the common ones. Microsoft is doing a good job with Bethesda.'
